        <h2 class="font1">Machine Learning: The Power Behind Intelligent Systems</h2>
        <p class="font1"> Machine Learning (ML) is a rapidly growing field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables 
            computers to learn from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It powers many of the smart
             technologies we use today, from recommendation systems to self-driving cars. But how does it work, and why is it so important?

            Understanding Machine Learning
            At its core, machine learning involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in data and make predictions or 
            decisions. Instead of relying on predefined rules, ML models improve their performance by analyzing past experiences. 
            This ability to learn from data makes machine learning a crucial technology in modern AI applications.
            
            The process of machine learning typically involves:
            
            Data Collection – Gathering large amounts of structured or unstructured data.
            Training the Model – Feeding data into an algorithm that identifies relationships and patterns.
            Testing & Optimization – Evaluating the model’s accuracy and fine-tuning it for better performance.
            Making Predictions – Applying the trained model to new data to generate insights or automated actions.
            Types of Machine Learning
            Machine learning is broadly categorized into three types:
            
            Supervised Learning – The model learns from labeled data, meaning it is trained with input-output pairs. 
            For example, an email spam filter is trained with emails labeled as spam or not spam to recognize similar patterns in future emails.
            
            Unsupervised Learning – The model works with unlabeled data and identifies hidden patterns without predefined 
            categories. A common example is customer segmentation, where businesses group customers based on purchasing behavior.
            
            Reinforcement Learning – The model learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment and 
            receiving rewards for correct actions. This approach is used in robotics and game-playing AI, like AlphaGo.
            
            Real-World Applications of Machine Learning
            Machine learning is transforming industries with its powerful applications:
            
            Healthcare: AI-powered systems diagnose diseases from medical scans with high accuracy.
            Finance: Fraud detection models analyze transaction data to identify suspicious activity.
            E-commerce: Recommendation engines suggest products based on customer preferences.
            Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars use ML to detect objects and make real-time driving decisions.
            Conclusion
            Machine learning is revolutionizing the way we interact with technology, making systems smarter and more efficient.
             As data-driven AI continues to evolve, ML will play an even bigger role in shaping our future. Understanding its 
             potential and challenges is key to harnessing its power responsibly.
